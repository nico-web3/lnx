# What is LNX

LNX is an innovative project that introduces a groundbreaking solution for deploying a Cartesi-powered Linux dApps across all the blockchain ecosystem. This project enables cross-chain communication, allowing computer-demanding decentralized applications (dApps) to seamlessly function on different blockchains.

LNX harnesses the robust capabilities of Cartesi, a versatile app-specific scaling solution, to create a Linux runtime dApp. The project addresses a critical challenge within the blockchain ecosystem by offering a solution that breaks the limitations of being confined to a single blockchain. These limitations encompass issues such as liquidity bottlenecks, restricted user bases, and constrained community engagement. LNX's cross-chain capabilities provide the flexibility to adapt, scale, and engage with diverse user communities across multiple blockchains while safeguarding against the rigidity of a single-chain approach, ensuring the longevity and versatility of dApps in an ever-evolving blockchain landscape.
