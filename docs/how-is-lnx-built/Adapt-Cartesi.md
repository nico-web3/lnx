# Adapt Console-echo front to communicate with Cartesi DApp

1. Clone rollups-example echo console.
	
2. Adapt localhost and local blockchain provider to sepolia, loading .env files.

3. We may need to deploy custom graphql for querying information. We try to add input information without crosschain, frontend -> Cartesi dAPP and see if information is queried.
